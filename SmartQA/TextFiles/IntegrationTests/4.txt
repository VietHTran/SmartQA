Assign grades to scores, but bad operand type error. 1st type boolean, 2nd type double

So I'm trying to assign grades "A, B, C, D, F" to individual scores in an array, but keep getting a bad operand error. I can see why it keeps giving me this error(since it's a boolean trying to compare to a double), but don't know would I would solve it. I tried to add parentheses, but no luck Here is my part of the code and the how grades are calculated.

     for(int s = 0; s < scores.length; s++) {
        if(mean + standard <= scores[s]) {
          gradesArray[s] = 'A';
        } 
        if(mean + (standard/3) <= scores[s] < mean + standard) {
          gradesArray[s] = 'B';
        }
        if(mean - (standard/3) <= scores[s] < mean + (standard/3)) {
          gradesArray[s] = 'C';
        }
        if(mean - standard <= scores[s] < mean - (standard/3)) {
          gradesArray[s] = 'D';
        }
        if(scores[s] < mean - standard) {
          gradesArray[s] = 'F';
        }

        for(int j =0; j < gradesArray.length; j++) {
          System.out.printf("%c\n", gradesArray[i]);
        }

    }
    
with ``scores[] = {60.5, 80.3, 70.2, 20.1, 90.9}`` how grades are calculated: `A = mean+standard <= score, B = mean+(standard/3) <= score < mean+standard, C = mean-(standard/3) <= score < mean+(standard/3), D = mean-standard <= score < mean - (standard/3), F = score < mean - standard`
